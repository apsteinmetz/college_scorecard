## Two Big Gaps

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(denisonbrand)
library(ggradar)
load_fonts()
```

Irrespective of what rankings people look at or don't, the DOE data shows two performance outliers.

-   Graduation Rate
-   Financial Outcomes

## A Tale of Three Schools
### WSJ Rankings: Normalized Survey Scores

```{r}
transpose_df <- function(df){
  df |> 
    pivot_longer(-1) |> 
    pivot_wider(names_from = 1,values_from = value)
}

three_schools <- read_csv("data/three_schools.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)

three_schools |> 
  filter(unit =="score") |> 
  select(-unit) |> 
  mutate(across(2:4,as.numeric)) |> 
  transpose_df()|> 
  ggradar(grid.max = 100,grid.mid=50,
          legend.position = "top",
          axis.label.size = 10,
          legend.text.size = 20,
          font.radar = den_fonts["den_display_sans"])

```

 
## Demographics: Did We Choose

### Or Did We Rationalize?

-   Middle class demographics
    -   We cite "economic diversity" as a strength.
    -   Is that a deliberate policy or an incidental outcome of our localized applicant pool?
    -   Would the college be stronger if we shrank the middle?

## Middle Income Students Replace Full Pay At Denison

```{r}
econ_diversity <- read_csv("data/econ_diversity.csv") |> 
  select(College,pell,middle,no_need) |>
  mutate(College = fct_reorder(College,middle))


econ_diversity |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(pell,middle,no_need)) |>
  mutate(name = as_factor(name)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = College,y = value,fill = name)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_den(axis.text=element_text(size=12)) +
  scale_fill_den() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Economic Diversity",
       subtitle="Ordered by Fraction of Middle Income Students",x = NULL,y = NULL)
```

## Financial Outcomes: Did We Choose

### Or Did We Rationalize?

-   Financial Outcomes
    -   Do our students choose lower paying careers than those at other schools?
    -   Do our majors align with lower paying careers?
    -   Does our location feed students back into a lower cost-of-living/salary region?
    -   Is our career development effective?
    -   Will the efforts we've made recently pay off in the future?
