## Two Big Gaps

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(denisonbrand)
load_fonts()
```

Irrespective of what rankings people look at or don't, the DOE data shows two performance outliers.

-   Graduation Rate
-   Financial Outcomes

## Three Schools In The WSJ Rubric

### Denison, Colgate, Elon

## Do We Choose

### Or Do We Rationalize (1) ?

-   Middle class demographics
    -   We cite that as a "diversity" strength.
    -   Is that a deliberate policy or an incidental outcome of our localized applicant pool?
    -   Would the college be stronger if we shrank the middle?

## Middle Income Students Replace Full Pay At Denison

```{r}
econ_diversity <- read_csv("../data/econ_diversity.csv") |> 
  select(College,pell,middle,no_need) |>
  mutate(College = fct_reorder(College,middle))


econ_diversity |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(pell,middle,no_need)) |>
  mutate(name = as_factor(name)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = College,y = value,fill = name)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_den() +
  scale_fill_den() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Economic Diversity",
       subtitle="Ordered by Fraction of Middle Income Students",x = NULL,y = NULL)
```

## Do We Choose

### Or Do We Rationalize (2) ?

-   Financial Outcomes
    -   Do our students choose lower paying careers than those at other schools?
    -   Do our majors align with lower paying careers?
    -   Does our location feed students back into a lower cost-of-living/salary region?
    -   Is our career development effective?
    -   Will the efforts we've made recently pay off in the future?
